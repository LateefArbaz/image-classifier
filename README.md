#Image Classifier using CNN

This project implements an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 images in 10 categories.

##How It Works
- The model uses a CNN to extract patterns from images and classify them into one of the 10 categories.
- We trained the model using TensorFlow and evaluated it on unseen images.

##How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install tensorflow matplotlib`
3. Run the script: `python image_classifier.py`
